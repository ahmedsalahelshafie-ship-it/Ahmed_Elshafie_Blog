        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Modern Wi-Fi must deliver both higher throughput and more stable latency in environments where interference and congestion change quickly. In the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands, one channel may be clean for a short time and then become busy due to neighboring networks. Traditional Wi-Fi typically operates on a single link at a time, so performance depends heavily on the condition of that one channel. Multi-Link Operation addresses (MLO) this limitation by allowing devices to use multiple links in parallel and dynamically choose the best one.</p>

            <h2>What is MLO?</h2>

            <p>MLO is a mechanism that enables a Wi-Fi device to establish and maintain more than one PHY link simultaneously. These links can be on different channels, and even on different bands such as 5 GHz and 6 GHz. Instead of treating connectivity as one pipe, the system treats it as a coordinated set of links that can be scheduled together to improve reliability, throughput, and latency.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The key advantage is flexibility. If one link becomes congested or suffers interference, the device does not need to pause and wait for the channel to clear. It can transmit or receive on another available link, keeping traffic moving.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This improves user experience for applications sensitive to delay variation, such as voice calls, gaming, video conferencing, and interactive cloud services.</p>

            <h2>MLO in Wi-Fi 7</h2>

            <p>In Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be), MLO is a core feature integrated into MAC scheduling and PHY operation. A multi-link capable access point can associate with a station using a multi-link device structure, where multiple links are coordinated under a single connection. The system can operate in different ways: it can steer traffic between links, split traffic across links for higher throughput, or duplicate critical packets across links for higher reliability.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Multi-Link Single Radio (eMLSR)</h2>

            <p>A key practical mode is eMLSR (enhanced Multi-Link Single Radio). Many client devices cannot afford multiple full radios due to cost and power constraints, so they operate with a single radio chain. With eMLSR, the station maintains multiple links at the MAC level but can actively transmit or receive on only one link at a time. The device rapidly switches its single radio between links based on scheduling decisions, channel contention, and traffic priority. This still provides major benefits because the device can avoid a congested link and move traffic to a cleaner link without tearing down the connection.</p>

            <h2>Comparison with Cellular Technologies</h2>

            <p>While MLO is a Wi-Fi-specific feature introduced in IEEE 802.11be, 3GPP cellular standards incorporate conceptually similar mechanisms, though implemented differently. In LTE and 5G NR, carrier aggregation (CA) allows simultaneous use of multiple frequency carriers to increase throughput. Additionally, 5G NR supports multi-TRP and multi-panel transmissions, where a user device can receive data from multiple transmission points or beams simultaneously to enhance reliability and reduce latency.</p>

            <h2>The Impact on User Experience</h2>

            <p>MLO represents a fundamental shift in how Wi-Fi manages connectivity. Instead of being constrained by the limitations of a single channel, devices can now leverage multiple paths to maintain consistent performance even in challenging environments. This makes Wi-Fi more robust, more responsive, and better suited to the demanding applications of modern wireless networks.</p>
