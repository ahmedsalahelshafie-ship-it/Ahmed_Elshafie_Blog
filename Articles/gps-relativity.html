            <p>Time is not as simple as it seems. We often think of a second as fixed and universal, but Albert Einstein showed that time is flexible, influenced by gravity and motion. This flexibility is crucial when we deal with satellites high above Earth, such as those in the Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>

            <p>Satellites orbit hundreds to thousands of kilometers above Earth's surface and travel at high speeds. Two key effects of Einstein's theory of relativity come into play here: gravitational time dilation and velocity time dilation.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational Time Dilation</h2>

            <p>According to general relativity, gravity affects the flow of time. Clocks in stronger gravitational fields tick slower, while clocks in weaker fields tick faster. For GPS satellites, which orbit far above Earth where gravity is weaker, this means their clocks run faster than identical clocks on the ground.</p>

            <h2>Velocity Time Dilation</h2>

            <p>Special relativity tells us that motion also affects time. A moving clock runs slower compared to a stationary one. GPS satellites move at roughly 14,000 km/h, so their motion causes a slight slowing of time, an effect opposite to gravitational time dilation.</p>

            <h2>Which Effect Wins?</h2>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>For GPS satellites, gravitational time dilation dominates over velocity time dilation. The net result is that satellite clocks tick faster than Earth-based clocks by about 38 microseconds per day. While this may seem tiny, if uncorrected it would translate to over 10 kilometers of positioning error each day, which would be catastrophic for navigation.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Relativistic Corrections in GPS</h2>

            <p>To maintain precision, GPS satellites include a relativistic correction in the time they broadcast to receivers. This ensures that the satellite's time, as seen by receivers on Earth, matches Earth-based clocks:</p>

            <div class="formula">
                t_corrected = t_satellite + Δt_rel
            </div>

            <p>Here, Δt_rel accounts for both gravitational and velocity time dilation. By applying this correction, GPS can achieve accuracy within meters, allowing everything from smartphone navigation to air traffic control to function reliably.</p>

            <p>Engineers deliberately pre-adjust the satellite's atomic clock frequency. Rather than operating at the nominal 10.23 MHz, the clock is tuned to run slightly slower at 10.22999999543 MHz.</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

            <p>This phenomenon highlights that Einstein's theories are not just abstract physics. They directly affect everyday technology. The precise timing of GPS satellites depends on understanding how time itself changes with height and speed. Without relativistic corrections, our navigation systems would fail, showing the subtle but profound influence of gravity and motion on the flow of time.</p>

            <p>Every time you use GPS to navigate, you are relying on Einstein's insights from over a century ago. It is a beautiful example of how fundamental physics enables practical technology that we use every day.</p>
